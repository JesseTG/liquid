Liquid is an open-source template language created by [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) and written in Ruby. It is the backbone of Shopify themes and is used to load dynamic content on storefronts. Liquid is also used in static site generators like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Liquid has been in production use since June 2006 and is now used by many other hosted web applications.

It was developed for usage in Ruby on Rails web applications and integrates seamlessly as a plugin but it also works well as a stand-alone library.
